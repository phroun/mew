// coalesce.go - undo coalescing: grouping a run of adjacent edits into
// a single history entry.
//
// DESIGN: an editor wants "typing a word" to be ONE undo step, not one
// per keystroke. When coalescing is enabled, an edit that continues the
// active run AMENDS the current revision instead of minting a new one:
// the revision's root is re-pointed at the new tree and the revision
// number does not move. Three run kinds coalesce, each independently
// (a run of one kind never absorbs another kind's op):
//   - insert: a keystroke that lands at the beginning or end of the
//     chunk the previous insert built (typing / prepend-typing);
//   - delete: a delete that keeps consuming from the same caret
//     location (forward delete at the point, or backspace walking left
//     into it);
//   - overwrite: an overwrite-mode keystroke that lands at the end of
//     what the run has written so far (the caret advances there), i.e.
//     replace-mode typing.
// One cross-kind transition is allowed, ONE-DIRECTIONAL: an insert may
// continue an OVERWRITE run at its end. This is "overtype mode" - the
// editor overwrites within a line, then switches to appending via
// inserts when it reaches the end - and the switch keeps coalescing.
// After it the run is an insert run, so it is one-way (a later overwrite
// bakes); Bake() opts out.
// The mechanism is the same for all three, and safe precisely because
// mutations path-copy into fresh node IDs - a revision's identity lives
// entirely in revisionInfo[rev].RootID, so re-pointing it atomically
// replaces the revision's content while every other revision keeps
// resolving through its own root.
//
// Runs end ("bake") at a HARD EDGE:
//   - Bake() - the app forces one (menu action completed, focus lost,
//     whatever policy it likes);
//   - AutoBakeTime - the new edit arrived more than this long after
//     the previous one (0 disables time-based baking);
//   - any non-continuation: a different kind (insert / delete /
//     overwrite never merge with each other), a non-adjacent position,
//     or any other mutation (move, copy, decorate, scarify, rebase, ...);
//   - history navigation (UndoSeek, ForkSeek) - resuming an old run
//     after looking around would rewrite what the user just inspected;
//   - a successful save - the save point pins the revision it wrote;
//     amending it afterwards would corrupt "revert to last save";
//   - TransactionStart - a transaction is its own (stronger) grouping:
//     everything inside collapses to one revision already, so
//     coalescing runs may freely exist within a bigger pending
//     transaction (they simply dissolve into it) and a fresh run
//     starts after it commits.
//
// Cursor history: the run's revision records cursor positions only
// when it FINISHES (the next non-amending mutation records them, as
// always, just before creating the next revision) - so undoing back
// onto a coalesced revision restores the end-of-run positions, and
// undoing past it restores the pre-run positions recorded when the
// run started.
//
// Adjacency is POSITION-based, not cursor-identity-based: whatever
// cursor performs the edit, what matters is where the bytes land.

// coalesceKind distinguishes the coalescible operations. Each kind runs
// separately: a run of one kind never absorbs an op of another (an
// overwrite adjacent to a typing run bakes the typing run and starts a
// fresh overwrite run, and vice versa).
